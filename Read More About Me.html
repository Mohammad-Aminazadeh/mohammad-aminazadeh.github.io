				<h2>Before University</h2>
				<p>I was born in 1998 in Shiraz, Iran. We moved to Isfahan when I was 6. I obtained my diploma in
					Mathematics and Physics with a GPA of 18.26 out of 20. After that I attended "The university
					entrance exam" (a.k.a "Konkur") and ranked 1,800 out of 165,000 Math & Physics examiner (Top 10%)
					after which I choosed to pursue my bachelor's at <a href="https://ui.ac.ir/EN">University of
						Isfahan.</a> "</p>


				<h2>My Bachelor's Journey</h2>
				<p>The first two years of my Bachelor's I studied Chemical Engineering which I did not show any interest
					in it and got unsatisfactory grades. I had an immense enthusiasm about "Problem Solving" even as a
					child, and got interested in coding. These were the paths to my major change to Computer Science,
					which was considered a major full of challenges that
					required vast skills in "Problem Solving" and "Critical Thinking". I showed such interest in my new
					major that my grades improved dramatically right after I started studying it.</p>

				<h2>Personal Interests and Skills</h2>
				<p>Besides my academic interests, I consider myself a professional equity investor and have a great
					interest in financial markets
					in order to solve problems others find difficult to solve or even find unsolvable. I realy enjoy
					applying machine learning to other fields of study to uncover knowledge in those areas.<br>I used to
					be a professional Swimmer and Waterpolo player. Nowadayes I just exercise to keep healthy.</p>
