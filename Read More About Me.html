				<h2>Before University</h2>
				<p>I was born in 1998 in Shiraz, Iran. 
					I earned a math and physics diploma with a grade point average of 18.26 out of 20. 
					After taking "The university entrance exam" (also known as "Konkur") 
					and ranking 1,800 out of 165,000 Math and Physics examiners (Top 10%), 
					I chose to pursue my bachelor's at the <a href="https://ui.ac.ir/EN">University of Isfahan.</a>
				</p>


				<h2>My Bachelor's Journey</h2>
				<p>I studied chemical engineering for the first two years of my bachelor's degree, 
					but I showed little interest in it and received below-average grades. Even as a young child, 
					I had a strong passion for "Problem Solving" and developed an interest in coding. 
					These were the routes that led me to my major change in computer science, 
					which was regarded as a challenging major requiring a wide range of "Problem Solving" 
					and "Critical Thinking" skills. My grades significantly increased as soon as I began studying 
					my new major because I showed such a strong interest in it.</p>

				<h2>Other Interests and Hobbies</h2>
				<p>In addition to my academic interests, I consider myself a professional equity investor and am 
					very interested in financial markets in order to find solutions to problems that others may find 
					challenging or impossible to solve. I really enjoy using machine learning to explore knowledge 
					in other academic disciplines. <br> I used to play water polo and swim professionally. 
					I just work out now to stay healthy.</p>
