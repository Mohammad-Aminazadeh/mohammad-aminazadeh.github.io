					<li><h2><B>City Intersection Clustering and Analysis Based on Traffic Time Series</B></h2></li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Abstract</h3>
				<p>In the past few years, the number of private
					vehicles has risen intensely and will continue to grow in the
					future. Traffic management has become a significant concern as
					traffic issues directly affect the quality of life. Different methods
					have been implemented to track city traffic and find ways to
					reduce congestion, accidents, pollution, etc., but there is room for
					improvement. This study attempts to analyze Isfahan traffic
					through clustering traffic time series of intersections to find
					similar locations in the city. The result of this study would help
					traffic managers define appropriate policies and tactics for
					managing similar intersections effectively, which brings about
					time and cost saving for both citizens and the government.</p>

					<h3>Abstract</h3>
					<p>In recent years, online learning has received more attention than ever before. One of
						the most challenging aspects of online education is the studentsâ€™ assessment since
						academic integrity could be violated due to various cheating behaviors in online
						examinations. Although a considerable number of literature reviews exist about
						online learning, there is no such review study to provide comprehensive insight into
						cheating motivations, cheating types, cheating detection, and cheating prevention
						in the online setting. The current study is a review of 58 publications about online
						cheating, published from January 2010 to February 2021. We present the categorization
						of the research and show topic trends in the field of online exam cheating. The
						study can be a valuable reference for educators and researchers working in the field
						of online learning to obtain a comprehensive view of cheating mitigation, detection,
						and prevention.</p>
